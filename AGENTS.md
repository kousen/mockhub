# MockHub — Project Instructions for Codex

## Project Overview

MockHub is a secondary concert ticket marketplace (like StubHub) built as a teaching platform for undergraduate AI students. The codebase must be clean, well-organized, and approachable for students reading it for the first time.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Spring Boot 4, Java 25, Gradle 9.4.0 (Kotlin DSL)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 17 (standard — pgvector removed, all search uses tsvector full-text)
- **AI:** Spring AI 2.0.0-M3 (milestone — requires Spring Milestones repo in Gradle)
- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, TanStack React Query, Zustand
- **Testing:** JUnit 5 + Mockito + Testcontainers (backend), Vitest + React Testing Library + MSW (frontend), Playwright (E2E, 3 browsers, sharded CI)
- **Payments:** Stripe test mode + mock fallback via Spring profiles

## Architecture Rules

### Backend

- **Feature-based packages**, not layer-based. Each domain concept (`event`, `ticket`, `cart`, `pricing`, etc.) is a self-contained package with controller/service/repository/entity/dto sub-packages.
- **Controller → Service → Repository** layer discipline:
  - Controllers never access repositories directly
  - Services call other services, never controllers
  - Entities never leak outside the service layer — use DTOs for all external communication
- **DTOs are Java records.** Use `*Request` records for incoming data (with Jakarta validation), `*Dto` for responses, `*SummaryDto` for list views.
- **Mapping is explicit** in service methods. No MapStruct, no Lombok. Keep it transparent for students.
- **No Lombok.** Java records for DTOs, explicit getters/setters for JPA entities. Students should see what the code does.
- **All write operations** use `@Transactional`. Read-only operations use `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`.
- **Database migrations** use Flyway (never JPA auto-DDL in any profile except `validate`).
- **Error handling** uses RFC 9457 Problem Details via `GlobalExceptionHandler` (`@RestControllerAdvice`). Returns `ProblemDetail` objects with `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail` fields. Domain exceptions are modeled as a sealed hierarchy (see DOP section).
- **Caching:** Use Spring `@Cacheable` annotations. Never cache carts, orders, notifications, or pricing data.
- **Spring profiles** control implementation variants:
  - `dev` — PostgreSQL, mock payment, mock SMS/email, debug logging, AI disabled (default). Profile group: `dev,mock-payment,mock-sms,mock-email`
  - `test` — Testcontainers PostgreSQL, mock payment
  - `mock-payment` / `stripe` — payment implementation (`@Primary` on Stripe resolves conflicts when both active)
  - `ai-anthropic` / `ai-openai` / `ai-ollama` — AI provider (each overrides the base AI exclusion list to enable only its own provider)
  - Base `application.yml` excludes all AI auto-configs. Each `ai-*` profile overrides with a narrower list.
  - To enable AI: `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev,ai-anthropic` (just add the provider to dev)

### Data Oriented Programming

The codebase uses Java DOP patterns where they add value:

- **Sealed exception hierarchy:** `DomainException` is `abstract sealed`, permitting `ResourceNotFoundException`, `ConflictException`, `PaymentException`, `UnauthorizedException` (all `final`). The `GlobalExceptionHandler` uses an exhaustive pattern-matching switch with no default case.
- **Records for all DTOs:** 43 out of 43 DTOs are records. `EventSearchRequest` uses a compact constructor to apply defaults and clamp bounds.
- **`PaymentService` is intentionally NOT sealed.** Mockito cannot mock sealed interfaces, which breaks `@WebMvcTest` controller tests. Testability wins over closed polymorphism here.
- **JPA entities cannot be records** (require mutable state, no-arg constructors). They use explicit getters/setters with `BaseEntity` superclass.

### AI Features

- **Conditional activation:** AI services use `@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "spring.ai.anthropic.api-key")` (NOT `@ConditionalOnBean` — that evaluates before auto-config creates the beans). The `AiController` injects `Optional<ChatService>` etc. and returns 503 when no AI provider is active.
- **Profile activation:** `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev,ai-anthropic` — just add the AI provider to dev.
- **Services:** `ChatService` (chat assistant with 10-message `MessageWindowChatMemory`), `PricePredictionService` (price trend analysis), `RecommendationService` (AI-ranked event recommendations).
- **ChatClient has function-calling tools.** `EventTools` and `PricingTools` are wired into the ChatClient via `.defaultToolCallbacks(ToolCallbacks.from(...))`. The same `@Tool`-annotated classes serve both the MCP server (external agents) and the chat endpoint (users on the website).
- **AI responses are parsed from JSON.** Services prompt the LLM for JSON output and parse with Jackson. Fallback logic returns safe defaults if parsing fails.
- **Circular dependency:** MCP tool registration → PricingTools → PricePredictionService → ChatClient creates a cycle. Broken with `@Lazy` on the `ChatClient` parameter in `PricePredictionService`.
- **ChatContext email enforcement:** Website chat tool calls use `ChatContext` (ThreadLocal) to override the LLM-provided `userEmail` with the authenticated user's email. Prevents prompt injection from operating as a different user. External MCP calls don't set the context, so `userEmail` is honored as-is. All tool classes use `ChatContext.resolveEmail(paramEmail)` for consistent resolution.
- **Circular dependency (eval variant):** When a bean that depends on `AnthropicChatModel` (like `evalJudgeChatClient`) is injected into a `@Component` collected via `List<EvalCondition>`, Spring eagerly resolves the entire list during context startup — `@Lazy` on the component class or the list parameter does NOT prevent this. Fix: remove `@Component` from the condition class and define it as a `@Bean` in a `@Configuration` class with `@Lazy` on the `ChatClient` parameter. This ensures the `ChatClient` proxy is only resolved at first method call, after the context is fully initialized. Unit tests won't catch this because they mock dependencies; only a full `@SpringBootTest` or production deploy with all profiles active will trigger the cycle.

### Evaluation Conditions

- **Design by Contract for AI agents.** Evaluation conditions are formalized sanity checks (preconditions, postconditions, invariants) that encode domain judgment. They prevent AI agents from taking technically correct but contextually inappropriate actions.
- **Package: `com.mockhub.eval`** — top-level package (cross-cutting, used by both AI services and MCP tools). Contains `EvalCondition` interface, DTOs (`EvalResult`, `EvalContext`, `EvalSeverity`, `EvalSummary`), concrete conditions in `condition/`, `EvalRunner` service in `service/`, config in `config/`.
- **Two types of conditions:** Deterministic (rule-based, always run, zero cost) and AI-as-judge (second LLM call, opt-in via `mockhub.eval.ai-judge.enabled`).
- **`EvalCondition` is NOT sealed** — must be mockable with Mockito, and extensible for students adding their own conditions.
- **Explicit calls, not AOP.** Services call `evalRunner.evaluate(context)` visibly. Students read the code and see where judgment happens.
- **Eval results are records, not exceptions.** Callers decide what to do — block (CartTools), fallback (PricePredictionService), or log-only (ChatService).
- **Separate `evalJudgeChatClient` bean** in `EvalConfig` — no tools, no memory, avoids circular dependency with main ChatClient.
- **Documentation:** `docs/evaluation-conditions.md` covers the concept, Design by Contract lineage, Nate Jones's contextual stewardship framework, and how to add new conditions.

### SMS Delivery

- **Profile-based SMS:** `SmsDeliveryService` interface with `MockSmsDeliveryService` (console logging, `mock-sms` profile) and `TwilioSmsDeliveryService` (real SMS, `sms-twilio` profile, `@Primary`).
- **`sendSms()` returns the provider message SID** (or null on failure) for delivery tracking.
- **Triggered on order confirmation:** `OrderService.confirmOrder()` sends SMS if user has a phone number. Message includes event name and link to public ticket view page (token-based, no auth required).
- **SMS failures are caught and logged** — never break the checkout flow.
- **Twilio SDK:** `com.twilio.sdk:twilio:10.9.2`. Auth via `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` env vars.
- **Phone number:** Optional field on `RegisterRequest`. Already on `User` entity. Frontend registration form includes it.
- **Integration test:** `TwilioSmsDeliveryServiceIntegrationTest` tagged `@Tag("twilio")`, excluded from normal test runs. Run with `./gradlew test -PincludeTags=twilio` (requires `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` env vars).
- **Dev profile group:** `dev: dev,mock-payment,mock-sms,mock-email` — mock SMS and email log to console by default.

### Email Delivery

- **Profile-based email:** `EmailDeliveryService` interface with three implementations:
  - `MockEmailDeliveryService` (console logging, `mock-email` profile)
  - `SmtpEmailDeliveryService` (Spring `JavaMailSender`, `email-smtp` profile) — works with any SMTP provider
  - `ResendEmailDeliveryService` (Resend REST API, `email-resend` profile, `@Primary`) — uses Spring `RestClient` to POST to `https://api.resend.com/emails`. Preferred in production because Railway blocks SMTP port 465.
- **Triggered on order confirmation:** `OrderService.confirmOrder()` sends HTML email with order summary and "View Your Tickets" button linking to the public ticket view page.
- **Email failures are caught and logged** — never break the checkout flow.
- **From address:** Configurable via `mockhub.email.from-address` (env: `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`). Production uses `tickets@updates.kousenit.com` (verified domain in Resend).
- **Multiple constructors:** `ResendEmailDeliveryService` has a package-private constructor for testing. The public constructor uses `@Autowired` to resolve ambiguity (Spring requires this when multiple constructors exist).

### Public Ticket View

- **Token-authenticated public page** at `/tickets/view?token={orderViewToken}` — no login required. Shows scannable QR codes for all tickets in an order.
- **Order-view JWT tokens:** Signed with the same HMAC-SHA256 key as ticket verification tokens, but distinguished by a `typ: "order-view"` claim. Generated by `TicketSigningService.generateOrderViewToken()`. Cannot be used to scan/verify tickets (no `tic` claim).
- **Two public endpoints:** `GET /api/v1/tickets/view?token=...` returns order + ticket details as `PublicOrderViewDto`. `GET /api/v1/tickets/{orderNumber}/{ticketId}/qr?token=...` returns QR code PNG image. Both validate the order-view token.
- **QR codes are the same as PDF tickets** — scanning at a venue triggers the existing `/api/v1/tickets/verify` flow with scan tracking.
- **SMS and email both link here** — replaces the old authenticated `/orders/{orderNumber}/confirmation` link.
- **Mobile-optimized frontend:** `PublicTicketViewPage` shows event name, date, venue, and large QR code cards. No PII exposed (no buyer name/email/phone).

### Ticket PDF Generation

- **Signed PDF tickets with QR codes.** On confirmed orders, each ticket can be downloaded as a PDF containing event details, seating info, and a QR code encoding a signed JWT verification token.
- **HMAC-SHA256 signing** with a separate secret (`mockhub.ticket.signing-secret`) from auth JWTs. Ticket tokens have no expiration.
- **Verification endpoint** (`GET /api/v1/tickets/verify?token={jwt}`) is public — QR scanning at venues doesn't require authentication. The signed JWT itself proves authenticity.
- **Scan tracking:** First scan sets `scannedAt` on `OrderItem`. Subsequent scans return "already scanned" warning.
- **Services:** `TicketSigningService` (JJWT signing/verification), `QrCodeService` (ZXing in-memory QR), `TicketPdfService` (PDFBox rendering, orchestrates the pipeline).
- **All in-memory** — no temp files. PDFBox uses standard Helvetica fonts (no custom font loading).
- **Frontend:** Download icon button on `OrderItemRow` (visible when order status is CONFIRMED). Uses blob download pattern.

### Seller Flow

- **Any authenticated user can sell.** No separate seller role — `seller_id` is nullable on `listings` (NULL = platform/primary-market listing, non-null = user-created resale listing).
- **Seller creates listing by describing seat:** `POST /api/v1/listings` with eventSlug, sectionName, rowLabel, seatNumber, price. Backend finds the matching Ticket, validates availability, sets seller, creates Listing.
- **Ownership enforcement:** Update price and deactivate check `listing.seller.id == authenticated user`. Throws `UnauthorizedException` on mismatch.
- **Duplicate prevention:** `existsByTicketIdAndStatus(ticketId, "ACTIVE")` rejects re-listing an already-listed ticket.
- **Earnings aggregation:** Computed from `OrderItem` where `listing.seller.id` matches and `order.status = 'COMPLETED'`.
- **Endpoints:** `POST /api/v1/listings`, `GET /api/v1/my/listings`, `PUT /api/v1/listings/{id}/price`, `DELETE /api/v1/listings/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/my/earnings`
- **Frontend:** 3 pages (SellPage with 3-step form, MyListingsPage with tab filtering, EarningsPage dashboard), seller API + hooks, nav links visible when authenticated.

### OAuth2 Social Login

- **Three providers:** Google, GitHub, Spotify via `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client`.
- **Stateless OAuth2 state:** `CookieOAuth2AuthorizationRequestRepository` stores OAuth2 state in HMAC-signed JSON cookies (not server sessions). Compatible with Railway's stateless deployment.
- **Code exchange flow:** `OAuth2AuthenticationSuccessHandler` generates a one-time code, redirects to `/auth/callback?code=...`, frontend exchanges via `POST /api/v1/auth/oauth2/exchange?code=...` (query param, not JSON body).
- **Pending auth cleanup:** `@Scheduled` every 5 min removes expired one-time codes from the `pendingAuths` map. Prevents unbounded memory growth from abandoned OAuth flows.
- **User linking:** First OAuth login creates a user account. Subsequent logins from the same email link the OAuth provider to the existing account via `OAuthAccount` entity.
- **Profile page:** `/my/profile` shows edit form (name, phone) and connected OAuth providers.
- **Environment:** `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` (Spotify uses the same vars as the API integration). `OAUTH2_FRONTEND_REDIRECT_URL` for Railway vs localhost.
- **`forward-headers-strategy: framework`** required in production for correct OAuth redirect URIs behind Railway's TLS proxy.

### Spotify Integration

- **Three phases shipped:** Phase 1 (API metadata), Phase 2 (embedded player, genre tags), Phase 3 (user listening history for personalized recommendations).
- **Client Credentials OAuth2:** `SpotifyApiService` authenticates with Spotify's token endpoint using Basic auth (client ID + secret). Tokens cached until near-expiry.
- **User OAuth2 (Phase 3):** `SpotifyListeningApiService` uses the user's OAuth access/refresh tokens (stored encrypted) to fetch `GET /v1/me/top/artists` and `GET /v1/me/player/recently-played`. Scopes: `user-read-email,user-top-read,user-read-recently-played`.
- **Token storage:** Spotify access/refresh tokens stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM) in `oauth_accounts` via `TokenEncryptionConverter` JPA AttributeConverter. Key from `SPOTIFY_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var (32-byte Base64). Random 12-byte IV per encryption.
- **Lazy token refresh:** On 401, `SpotifyListeningApiService` refreshes via `POST /api/token` with `grant_type=refresh_token`. Updates stored tokens. Falls back to stale cache on failure.
- **Listening cache:** `spotify_listening_cache` table (JSONB columns) caches top artist IDs/names, genres, recently played artist IDs per user. 24-hour TTL. Minimizes API calls under Spotify's 5-user dev mode cap.
- **Incremental consent:** `scopes_granted` column on `OAuthAccount` tracks which scopes were granted. `SpotifyListeningService` returns `scopeUpgradeNeeded=true` if `user-top-read` or `user-read-recently-played` is missing. Frontend shows "Update permissions" button.
- **Connect/disconnect:** `SpotifyConnectionService` manages connection status and disconnect (deletes tokens + listening cache). `GET/DELETE /api/v1/spotify/connection`.
- **Privacy cleanup:** `SpotifyDataCleanupScheduler` runs nightly to remove orphaned cache entries where user no longer has a Spotify OAuth account.
- **Enhanced recommendations:** `RecommendationService` injects `Optional<SpotifyListeningService>`. Spotify artist names and genres are added to the AI prompt. Events matching the user's Spotify artist IDs are included in the candidate pool even if not featured. Optional `city` query parameter filters both featured and Spotify-matched events (case-insensitive).
- **Mock implementation:** `MockSpotifyListeningService` (`mock-spotify` profile) returns hardcoded Beyonce/Drake/Radiohead data. No Spotify credentials needed for dev/testing.
- **Spotify dev mode cap:** 5 allowlisted users max, each needs Spotify Premium. Extended Quota Mode requires 250K MAU — not applicable for teaching projects. The 24-hour cache and mock profile make the feature usable within this constraint.
- **Artist ID validation:** Spotify IDs are 22-char base62 strings. Validated with `^[a-zA-Z0-9]{22}$` regex in `SpotifyApiService.getArtist()` and `@Pattern` on `EventCreateRequest.spotifyArtistId`.
- **Iframe URL encoding:** Frontend uses `encodeURIComponent()` on artist IDs in both the embed iframe `src` and "Open in Spotify" link `href`.
- **Embedded player limitation:** Playback doesn't work due to browser third-party cookie partitioning (Spotify Connect returns 403). A note below the player explains this and directs users to the "Open in Spotify" link.
- **Rate limit retry:** Exponential backoff with `Retry-After` header support. Max 3 retries.
- **Caching:** Artist metadata cached 1 hour in `ConcurrentHashMap`.
- **Profile-based:** `spotify` profile activates `SpotifyApiService` (`@Primary`) and `SpotifyListeningApiService`. Without it, mock implementations return empty/hardcoded data.

### Lifecycle Cleanup

- **`LifecycleCleanupService`** — `@Scheduled` every 15 min (configurable via `mockhub.lifecycle.cleanup-interval`).
- **Four operations:** (1) Expire ACTIVE listings past `expires_at` → EXPIRED, (2) Expire ACTIVE listings for past events → EXPIRED, (3) Mark past ACTIVE events as COMPLETED, (4) Delete read notifications older than 30 days.
- **Ticket release:** When listings expire, their tickets are released from LISTED back to AVAILABLE. Uses SELECT + iterate (not bulk UPDATE) because both listing and ticket state must update together.
- **Listing → SOLD:** `OrderService.markTicketsAsSold()` also sets `listing.status = "SOLD"`.
- **Cancel re-activates:** `OrderService.releaseOrderTickets()` resets listing status back to ACTIVE alongside ticket release.
- **MCP session recovery:** `McpSessionRecoveryFilter` converts Spring AI's "Session not found" JSON-RPC errors (HTTP 200) to HTTP 404, enabling `mcp-remote` clients to detect stale sessions after Railway redeploys.

### Calendar Integration

- **RFC 5545 iCalendar** (.ics) file generation via `CalendarService`.
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/orders/{orderNumber}/calendar` — authenticated, returns `.ics` file download with event name, date/time, venue address, doors-open time, ticket count, and order number.
- **MCP tool:** `getCalendarEntry` in `OrderTools` — returns `.ics` content for agent-driven post-purchase flows.
- **Frontend:** "Add to Calendar" button on `OrderConfirmationPage` (visible for CONFIRMED orders only), triggers blob download.
- **No external dependencies** — `.ics` is a text format generated with `StringBuilder`. The OS handles import into any calendar app.

### Agentic Commerce

- **Three-layer architecture:** (1) MCP tools for agent capabilities, (2) Mandates for agent authorization, (3) ACP endpoints for protocol interoperability. See `docs/agentic-commerce.md` for full documentation.
- **`llms.txt`** — served at `/llms.txt` (static resource), describes all API endpoints, MCP tools, and ACP endpoints for AI agents.
- **RFC 9457 Problem Details** — all error responses use Spring's `ProblemDetail` format for machine-readable errors.
- **MCP server** — 23 tools registered (EventTools, PricingTools, CartTools, OrderTools, MandateTools) via `spring-ai-starter-mcp-server-webmvc`. API key auth on `/mcp/**` via `McpApiKeyFilter`. Uses Streamable HTTP transport (protocol: `STREAMABLE`) at `/mcp`. Codex Desktop requires `mcp-remote` bridge for auth headers: `{"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mockhub.kousenit.com/mcp", "--header", "X-API-Key: <key>"]}`.
- **MCP tools identify users by email** — cart and order tools accept `userEmail` parameter, not auth tokens.
- **Complete agent purchase flow:** `findTickets` → `addToCart` → `checkout` → `confirmOrder` — agents can now execute full purchases.
- **`findTickets` compound tool** — single-call search with query, category, city, date range, price range, section filter, returning matching listings sorted by price. Uses JPA `Specification` with `findBy` fluent API (no `COUNT` query overhead). `ListingSearchCriteria` record encapsulates all filters; `ListingSearchSpecification` builds predicates dynamically for non-null criteria only. Date parameters are `String` (not `Instant`) because Spring AI MCP can't deserialize ISO-8601 to `Instant`. Reduces agent round-trips from 3 to 1. Server-side execution: ~54ms.
- **`getEventListings` paginated** — accepts `page`/`size` params (default 20, max 50), returns `{ listings, page, size, totalListings }`. Without pagination, popular events (500+ listings) exceeded MCP context limits.
- **`getCalendarEntry` tool** — returns RFC 5545 .ics content for a confirmed order.
- **`SpendingLimitCondition`** — WARNING eval condition when cart exceeds configurable limit (`mockhub.eval.max-cart-total`, default $2000).

### Agent Mandates

- **Authorization model for agents.** A `Mandate` record defines what an agent can do on behalf of a user: scope (BROWSE/PURCHASE), spending limits (per-transaction + cumulative), category/event restrictions, expiration.
- **`MandateCondition`** — CRITICAL eval condition that blocks agent actions without a valid mandate. Checks scope, spending limits, and category/event constraints.
- **MandateTools** — 5 MCP tools for mandate lifecycle: `createMandate`, `revokeMandate`, `listMandates`, `validateMandate`, `getBestMandate` (compound lookup, recommended before `addToCart`).
- **Mandate entity** in `com.mockhub.mandate` package. Flyway migration `V22__create_mandates_table.sql`.
- **Inspired by AP2** (Google's Agent Payments Protocol) — mandates are MockHub's implementation of AP2's digitally signed authorization concept, enforced through the eval conditions framework.
- **PURCHASE scope subsumes BROWSE** — an agent authorized to buy can also browse.

### ACP (Agentic Commerce Protocol)

- **ACP-compatible endpoints** at `/acp/v1/` — RESTful checkout API compatible with the Stripe+OpenAI Agentic Commerce Protocol.
- **Six endpoints:** `POST /checkout` (create), `GET /checkout/{id}` (status), `PUT /checkout/{id}` (update), `POST /checkout/{id}/complete`, `POST /checkout/{id}/cancel`, `GET /catalog` (product discovery).
- **Pure adapter layer** — wraps existing CartService + OrderService. No business logic was modified.
- **API key auth** via `AcpApiKeyFilter` — same `mockhub.mcp.api-key` property as MCP, independent filter.
- **SPA exclusion** — `/acp/**` added to `SpaForwardingConfig` exclusion list.

### Frontend

- **TypeScript** — no `any` types. Use proper interfaces defined in `src/types/`.
- **React Query (TanStack)** for all server state. Zustand only for client-side UI state (auth token, cart drawer, mobile nav).
- **API layer:** `src/api/*.ts` files export typed functions. `src/hooks/use*.ts` files wrap them in React Query hooks. Components use hooks, never call API functions directly.
- **shadcn/ui components** live in `src/components/ui/` (18 components including Tooltip). Custom components live in feature folders (`events/`, `cart/`, `checkout/`, `sell/`, etc.).
- **`TooltipProvider`** wraps the app in `App.tsx` (required by Radix Tooltip). Must also be included in `test-utils.tsx` `renderWithProviders` wrapper — any new provider added to `App.tsx` must be mirrored there.
- **Tooltips on disabled elements:** Disabled buttons swallow pointer events. Wrap with `<span className="inline-flex" tabIndex={0}>` to restore hover/focus for the tooltip trigger (see `FavoriteButton.tsx` for the pattern).
- **Mobile-first** responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints.
- **No inline styles.** Use Tailwind utility classes exclusively.
- **Error responses:** Frontend `ApiError` type uses `detail` field (RFC 9457), not `message`.

### Testing

- **Every feature must have tests.** This is non-negotiable.
- **Tests MUST be written before pushing.** Do not rely on SonarCloud to catch coverage gaps. SonarCloud enforces 80% coverage on new code — every untested new method tanks the metric. Write the test immediately after (or before) writing the production method. Run `./gradlew test jacocoTestReport` locally and verify coverage on new files before creating a PR. Repeated quality gate failures from missing tests are unacceptable.
- Backend unit tests: JUnit 5 + Mockito, naming convention `methodName_givenCondition_expectedResult`
- Backend controller tests: MockMvc + @WebMvcTest
- Backend integration tests: Testcontainers with real PostgreSQL
- Frontend component tests: Vitest + React Testing Library, colocated as `*.test.tsx`
- Frontend API mocking: MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- **jsdom polyfills:** `ResizeObserver` stub is in `src/test/setup.ts` — required for any Radix UI component that uses poppers/tooltips. Add other browser API stubs here as needed.
- **Tooltip testing:** Use `findByRole('tooltip')` not `findByText` — Radix renders tooltip content in two DOM locations (visible + accessible hidden), causing `findByText` to fail with duplicate matches.
- E2E tests: Playwright configured for Chrome, Safari, Mobile iOS (3 browsers covering all rendering engines). Sharded across 2 CI jobs for faster runs.
- E2E accessibility checks: axe-core via `@axe-core/playwright`

### Code Style

- **Backend:** Follow standard Java conventions. Indentation: 4 spaces. Max line length: 120 characters.
- **Frontend:** ESLint + Prettier enforced. Indentation: 2 spaces. Single quotes. Trailing commas.
- **Comments:** Only where logic isn't self-evident. No boilerplate javadoc on obvious methods.
- **Naming:**
  - Java: `PascalCase` for classes, `camelCase` for methods/variables, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
  - TypeScript: `PascalCase` for components/types, `camelCase` for functions/variables, `kebab-case` for file names
  - Database: `snake_case` for tables and columns
  - API paths: `kebab-case` (`/api/v1/price-history`)

### Git Conventions

- Feature branches: `feature/<description>`
- Commit messages: imperative mood, concise ("Add event search filtering", not "Added event search filtering functionality")
- One logical change per commit
- Use TDD on feature branches: write tests first (RED), implement (GREEN), refactor

## CI / Quality

- **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on push to main and PRs: backend tests, frontend lint/typecheck/tests, SonarCloud analysis, Docker build smoke test
- **SonarCloud** — org: `kousen-it-inc`, project: `kousen_mockhub`. All config is in `sonar-project.properties` at the repo root (both backend and frontend). CI uses `SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action` (not the Gradle plugin). Token stored as `SONAR_TOKEN` GitHub secret. Both JaCoCo (backend) and lcov (frontend) coverage feed the quality gate.
- **Issue exclusions** are in `sonar-project.properties`: S1186 (JPA empty constructors), S1192 (seed data literals), S3776 (seed data complexity), S6218 (byte[] record), S6863 (verification endpoint), S7746 (Axios throw style).
- **SonarQube MCP server** is available in this project. Use it to query SonarCloud for issues, quality gate status, and hotspots. When fixing code, check SonarCloud issues first.
- **GitHub repo:** `kousen/mockhub` (public, MIT license)

## Deployment

- **Platform:** Railway (Hobby plan, $5/mo minimum)
- **URL:** https://mockhub.kousenit.com
- **Architecture:** Single Docker container serves both Spring Boot API and React SPA (no CORS needed)
- **Dockerfile:** Root `Dockerfile` builds frontend (Node), bundles into Spring Boot jar, runs on JRE Alpine
- **SPA routing:** `SpaForwardingConfig` serves `index.html` for client-side routes, excludes `api/`, `actuator/`, `mcp/`, `acp/`, `swagger-ui/`, `v3/` paths
- **Security:** Static frontend routes (`/`, `/events/**`, `/sell`, `/my/**`, etc.) are `permitAll()` in SecurityConfig. CORS allows the Railway production domain.
- **Ephemeral filesystem:** Seed images are restored from classpath on every container startup via `restoreSeedImages()` in `EventSeeder`
- **Profiles:** `prod,ai-anthropic,mock-payment,sms-twilio,email-resend` — production datasource, Anthropic AI, mock payment, real SMS and email
- **Database:** Railway PostgreSQL with separate `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`, `_USERNAME`, `_PASSWORD` env vars (Railway's `DATABASE_URL` format is incompatible with JDBC)
- **JWT secret:** Must be valid Base64 (no dots or special characters)
- **Auto-deploy:** Pushes to `main` trigger automatic Railway deployments

## What NOT to Do

- Do not use `var` in Java (use explicit types for readability — this is a teaching codebase)
- Do not add dependencies without justification — check `build.gradle.kts` for what's already included
- Do not use `localStorage` for JWT tokens (security anti-pattern — use in-memory + HttpOnly refresh cookie)
- Do not write Flyway migrations with `ddl-auto: create` or `update` (always `validate`)
- Do not create REST endpoints that bypass the service layer
- Do not suppress exceptions silently — log or rethrow as domain exceptions
- Do not use `@Autowired` on fields — use constructor injection (implicit with single constructor)
- Do not seal interfaces that need Mockito mocking in `@WebMvcTest` tests (Mockito can't create subclasses of sealed types)
- Do not add SonarCloud issue exclusions anywhere other than `sonar-project.properties` at the repo root
